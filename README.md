Severe Robot Task Tracker
-------------------------

This is a school project made by [Gabi Purcaru](http://gabi.purcaru.com)
and Gheorghe Popescu. It is intended to be a [heroku](http://www.heroku.com/)-compatible
[nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) task tracker (issue/bug tracker; I prefer 'task'). It is a lightweight
solution that also serves for personal purposes. It is also designed to be message-centric,
more like a task-enabled shoutbox. You can see a live demo here: http://severe-robot.herokuapp.com/
